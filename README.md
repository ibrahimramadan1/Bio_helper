Sequencing machines take a biological material (like DNA) as an input,
and then it maps this biological material to a sequence of characters stored in text file. 
It becomes the role of Computer Scientists develop the algorithms and tools that can efficiently store,
analyze and visualize the different types of biological sequences located in hugeâ€¦
